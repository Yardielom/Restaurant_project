# Restaurant_project

Good afternoon,

I apologize for the late submission of my project. Due to time constraints, I focused on completing the core functionalities and I am sharing it after finishing with my work.

I recommend testing the project primarily by logging in as a user to explore the user-specific features. Of course, please also log in as an admin to test the administrative functionalities, because this is the first time I upload a project in github I encourage you to let me know if there was any kind of problem with downloading my project or if there were some missing parts.

Thank you for your understanding, and I hope you like my project.
